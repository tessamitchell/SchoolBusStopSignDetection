# SchoolBusStopSignDetection
Final Project for Digital Image Processing.  Detecting school bus stop signs by the flashing lights in a still image.

My project only ended up being partially successful.  The full report can be read in DIPFall2025_Mitchell_Tessa_Final.pdf

The final code can be found in 3 different locations, depending on your formatting preference:
- StopSignDetection.ipynb
  - Cleaned up Jupyter Notebook
- stopsigndetection.py
  -  Cleaned up Python file (converted from the aforementioned notebook)
- FinalProject.ipynb
  - WIP Jupyter Notebook (has a lot of code that went unused in the final product), due to me testing out different methods over time
